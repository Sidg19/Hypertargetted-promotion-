## Introduction
Coupon redemption prediction is a crucial problem in the retail industry. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can effectively predict whether a customer will redeem a coupon during a campaign based on various features such as customer demographics, past transaction history, and coupon details. 
## Requirements
To run this project, you will need: - Python 3.x - Libraries: - NumPy - pandas - matplotlib - seaborn - xgboost - re (built-in module) - collections (built-in module) - os (built-in module) Please ensure that you have these libraries installed on your machine before running the code. 
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of several CSV files: - `train.csv`: Training dataset containing campaign and customer information. - `coupon_item_mapping.csv`: Mapping between coupons and items available for purchase. - `campaign_data.csv`: Campaign details such as campaign type and duration. - `customer_transaction_data.csv`: Customer transaction details, including purchase information and coupon discounts. - `customer_demographics.csv`: Customer demographic data, including age, marital status, and family size. - `item_data.csv`: Details of items available for purchase. - `test.csv`: Testing dataset for final predictions. - `sample_submission_Byiv0dS.csv`: Sample submission file. Please ensure that you have downloaded and placed these data files in the correct directory as specified in the code before running the code. 
## Installation
To install the required libraries, you can use the following pip command: ```bash pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn xgboost

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Ensure that you have the required data files in the specified directory (~/kaggle/input/ in this case).
    Install the required libraries using the installation steps provided above.
    Run the Python script coupon_redemption_prediction.py.

## Results

The trained XGBoost classifier's performance can be evaluated using various metrics like ROC-AUC, accuracy, and confusion matrix. The final predictions on the test dataset can be saved in a CSV file for submission
